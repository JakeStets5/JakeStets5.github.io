            <h2>Swine Fever Project</h2>
            <p>This project is an integrated web application developed to assist researchers and veterinarians in tracking and managing African swine fever outbreaks. My primary goal with this application was to create a reliable, user-friendly tool that uses machine learning to analyze and classify test results for African swine fever and then consolidates these findings into a broader, actionable map for disease density and spread.</p>
            <p>I leveraged many resources from Microsoft Azure to complete and deploy this project. Among these resources are:</p>
            <ul class="resource-list">
                <li>Custom Vision</li>
                <li>Key Vault</li>
                <li>Storage Accounts</li>
                <li>App Services</li>
                <li>Managed Identity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On the backend, I've designed and implemented a RESTful API that serves a frontend built in React. User account management, including sign-up and sign-in functionality, is secured and utilizes Azure for both image storage and database management, helping ensure data persistence and secure access to user data. To make this project scalable, I integrated Azure Key Vault to manage secrets and used Application Insights to monitor performance. The result is a tool that not only helps track a major agricultural disease but also creates a collaborative network for researchers and agricultural experts.</p>
